# MojoGOAT - A Graph Of All Things

## Overview
GOATs help structure information sematically by taking an ontological rather than a taxonomical approach. 
In this implementation of the GOAT, we take the semantic structure: <source><story><target><date> - i.e. a quad
A set of quads can be represented as a table, a CSV, a plain delimited text, or a more complex data structure
The GOAT takes a set of quads and sets up a way to feed it into a neo4j graph database using python bindings. The graph data structure, as well as the simplified underlying quad storage can be queried using a simple REST API


## GOAT Sutras

1. You can own a GOAT, some GOATs, many GOATs, big GOATs, small GOATs, public GOATs, private GOATs and so forth but no one THE GOAT
2. GOATs will eat almost everything, don't feed a GOAT rubbish unless you want a sick GOAT
3. When a GOAT gets too fat, make biryani
